        <h1>Spells </h1>
           
        <br><br> <h2>Learning Magic:</h2>  <br> 
        Before you can start casting spells, you must meet four criteria:
            <li>You must have a Magic Characteristic of 1 or more.</li>
            <li>You must know the Channelling skill.</li>
            <li>You must speak an Arcane Language.</li>
            <li>You must have access to spells through the Petty Magic, Arcane  Lore, Dark Lore or Divine Lore talents. </li> <br>
        The quickest way to meet all these criteria is to get into a spellcasting career, such as Priest or Wizard. Only these careers have an increase to the Magic Characteristic on their Advance Scheme.

        <br><br> <h2>Casting Spells:</h2>  <br> 
        When you want to cast a spell, you must draw upon the power of the Winds of Magic and focus it into your desired effect (the chosen spell). 
        To do this take the cast action and then roll a number of d10s equal to your Magic Characteristic. Now total the dice. 
        This is your Casting Roll. If the result is equal to or greater than the spell’s Casting Number, it is cast successfully. 
        You may roll a number of d10s less than your Magic Characteristic if you want to (and indeed, it’s often a good idea). 
        Casting is often an extended action, which means you must continue casting a spell until it’s finished. 
        As per the normal rules, you may abort the spell part way through, but this means all actions taken thus far are wasted.<br><br>

        <h3 class="header3"><p>Channeling and Ingredients:</p></h3> <br>
        There are two ways you can increase your chances of casting a spell. First, you can make a Channelling Skill Test right before the spell is cast. 
        Doing so is a half action. Channelling helps you focus the energy of the Winds of Magic. 
        If the test is successful, you add a bonus equal to your Magic Characteristic to your Casting Roll. 
        If you use Channelling, casting a spell must be your next action. <br><br>Your other option is to use special ingredients. 
        If you have the correct ingredient, it provides a bonus of +1 to +3 to your Casting Roll. 
        An ingredient is only good for one casting of a spell and you must decide to use it before you make your Casting Roll. 
        The availability of ingredients can vary depending on your location and the nature of the item, 
        but generally speaking ingredients that provide a +1 bonus are Common, a +2 bonus are Scarce, and a +3 bonus are Rare. 
        The more esoteric ingredients can’t be found in any shop and must be acquired personally, often at great risk.<br><br>

        <h3 class="header3"><p>Automatic Failure:</p></h3> <br>
        When magic is involved, nothing is certain. Regardless of a spell’s Casting Number,
        if all the d10s of your Casting Roll come up 1, the spell fails. 
        In addition, you must take a Will Power Test or gain an Insanity Point as the uncontrolled magical energy sears your mind. 
        Because they only roll 1d10 to begin with, novice spellcasters are in greater danger than their more experienced elders.<br><br>

        <h3 class="header3"><p>Curse or Wrath of God:</p></h3> <br>
        Magic can be unpredictable. The more power you use to cast a spell, the more likely it is that something unexpected will happen. 
        If you are a spellcaster, this takes effect when you roll doubles, triples, or quadruples on your Casting Roll. 
        The more d10s you roll, the more deadly the effect becomes. 
        <li>If you roll doubles, roll percentile dice and consult <em>Curse or Wrath of God table</em>. </li>
        <li>If you roll triples, roll percentile dice and consult <em>Curse or Wrath of God table</em>.</li>
        <li>If you roll quadruples, roll percentile dice and consult <em>Curse or Wrath of God table</em>. </li>
        <li>If you roll multiple matches on one Casting Roll, there can be more than one manifestation.</li> <br>

        <h3 class="header3"><p>Spellcasting limits:</p></h3> <br>
        You must be able to speak to cast spells. It is through invocations in the various arcane languages that the Winds of Magic can be manipulated. 
        If you cannot speak for any reason (you’re gagged, for example) you cannot cast spells. Spellcasting also requires a high degree of concentration. 
        This is not a problem for spells that take a full or half action to cast, since you can cast those on your turn without interruption. 
        Spells that require extended actions, however, take so long to cast that you become vulnerable to outside interference. 
        If anything breaks your concentration—most commonly when you take damage or are the target of a hostile spell—you must 
        make a successful Channelling Test or be forced to abort the spellcasting action. 
        As always, the GM should modify this depending on the circumstances.<br><br>
        
        <h3 class="header3"><p>Magic Missiles:</p></h3> <br>
        magIC mIssIles Certain spells, like fire ball, are classified as magic missiles. 
        This means that (like normal ranged attacks) you must have line of sight to your target. 
        If you cannot see your target, you cannot use a magic missile spell against him. 
        Unless stated otherwise, magic missile spells automatically hit their targets if cast successfully.<br><br>

        <h3 class="header3"><p>Protective Circles:</p></h3> <br>
        Arcane spellcasters can minimize the risk of Curse by creating a magical circle that helps control Aethyric energy. 
        The materials required to make a protective circle are Scarce and cost a number of gold crowns equal to the Casting Number of the chosen spell. 
        A protective circle takes 1 minute and a successful Channelling Test to create and is good for one casting (successful or not). 
        If you cast a spell from within a properly created protective circle, you may re-roll one d10 of your Casting Roll. 
        The results of the re-roll are final.<br><br>

        <h3 class="header3"><p>Spellcasters and armor:</p></h3> <br>
        Armour interferes with a spellcaster’s ability to channel magical energy. 
        While it is possible to cast spells while wearing armour or using a shield, it makes the process more difficult. 
        The effects of armour and shields on spellcasting are as follows:
        <li>If you are wearing light armour (Basic) or only leather armour (Advanced), you suffer a –1 penalty on all Casting Rolls.</li>
        <li>If you are wearing medium armour (Basic) or any type of mail (Advanced), you suffer a –3 penalty on all Casting Rolls.</li>
        <li>If you are wearing heavy armour (Basic) or any type of plate or helm (Advanced), you suffer a –5 penalty on all Casting Rolls.</li>
        <li>If you are equipped (i.e. actively using) with a shield you suffer a –1 penalty on all Casting Rolls. If you have both shield and armour, you suffer both penalties.</li> <br><br>

        <h3 class="header3"><p>Spells and Hit Locations:</p></h3> <br>
        Some spells, such as fire ball and shadow knives, inflict damage directly. 
        This is calculated just like normal missile damage, (1d10 + Damage) minus (Toughness Bonus + Armour Points), 
        unless the spell specifically states otherwise (some spells, for example, ignore armour). 
        If you are using the advanced armour system or a Critical Hit is inflicted, you should roll percentile dice to determine the hit location. 
        The Ulric’s Fury rule applies to damage from spells as well. 
        However, rather than make a Weapon Skill Test to determine if extra damage is caused, a spellcaster makes a Will Power Test instead.<br><br>

        <h3 class="header3"><p>Touch Spells:</p></h3> <br>
        Some spells require you to touch the subject. In non-combat situations, adjudicating this is easy enough. 
        In the chaos of melee, however, touching your opponent is more difficult. 
        Whenever you want to cast a spell requiring touch, you must make a successful Weapon Skill Test. 
        This is considered part of the spell casting action, so does not require you to make a separate attack action. 
        It is possible to dodge and parry touch spells, but at a –20% penalty.<br><br>
