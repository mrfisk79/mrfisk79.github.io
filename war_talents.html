            associated with it. Dark Lore is unsual in that it is not one talent, but many. Each Dark Lore talent is a separate magical proficiency,

            The most common Dark Lores are:
            <br><br>
                <ul class="columns" style="columns: 1;">
                    <li>Chaos</li>
                    <li>Necromancy</li>

            <h4><p id="Dark_agic">Dark Magic:</p></h4> <br>You know how to manipulate Dhar (black magic) to fuel your spells. 
            Using Dark Magic gives you more power, but is much more dangerous. When you cast a spell, you can opt to use the energy of Dhar to fuel it. 
            When making a Casting Roll for a Dark Magic spell, you roll an extra d10 and drop the die with the lowest result. 
            However, all dice count for the purposes of Arcane Curse. 
            For example, a wizard with Magic 2 who casts a dark magic spell rolls 3d10 and uses the highest two dice for his Casting Roll. 
            All three dice are used to determine Arcane Curse. 
            If he rolled a 6, 6, and 6, the Casting Roll would be 12 (6+6), but the spell would trigger a Major Chaos Manifestation. 
            You muse use Dark Magic when casting a Dark Lore spell.<br><br>
